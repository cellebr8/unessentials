/**
 * Launches a coroutine which manages a UI flow expressed via a dynamic sequence of modals.
 *
 * Each modal in the sequence should be displayed by calling [ModalFlow.awaitModal], which will similarly to
 * [suspendCancellableCoroutine] suspend the calling coroutine until the modal calls [ModalContinuation.resume] with
 * a result, which is then returned from the [ModalFlow.awaitModal] call.
 * The [ModalContinuation.resume] call itself is also suspending and will only return once a new modal has been queued
 * via [ModalFlow.awaitModal], which it then returns. This allows the previous modal to have control over what is
 * displayed while the main ModalFlow coroutine is preparing the next modal, e.g. it can continue to be visible but
 * have the button disabled until the next modal is ready.
 *
 * Calling [ModalFlow.awaitModal] will therefore automatically prompt the previous modal to replace itself with the new
 * modal and no manual tracking of the previous modal is necessary.
 *
 * When the coroutine ends, the previous modal is prompted to replace itself with `null`.
 *
